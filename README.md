# Raccs'n'Drugs

### This racoons have found some white powder that strengthen them! Who will be the leader of the gaze?
Game inspired in Toadstool Titan/Mushroom pit from Mario Party 3/Mario Party Supertstars.

## Instructions:
Gameplay starts at a menu, with various UI elements that permit switch froms erver to client and back, text input fields for input player name, server IP (in case of connectiong to host), selected port (even if you are the host), and buttons for creating a lobby as a server, joining a lobby as a client, and starting game as a server (notifies clients).
Game is about kicking other players with your super doped strength, aquired by stepping on certain cocayne bags (only one of which contains the power). Movement follows WSAD pattern, and SPACE bar is for charging a dash while buffed up, then discharging it onto others in a direction pointed by an arrow.
